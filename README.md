<strong>UPDATE:</strong> The current full version of Coswara data is now published with open access in <strong>Nature Scientific Data</strong>, 2023. [read](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02266-0)

Project Coswara by Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore is an attempt to build a diagnostic tool for COVID-19 detection using the audio recordings such as breathing, cough and speech sounds of an individual. Currently, the project is in the data collection stage through crowdsourcing. To contribute your audio samples, please go to Project Coswara(https://coswara.iisc.ac.in/). The exercise takes 5-7 minutes.

<strong>What am I looking at?</strong>
This github repository contains the raw audio data collected through https://coswara.iisc.ac.in/ . Every participant contributes nine sound samples. You can read the paper: [Coswara - A Database of Breathing, Cough, and Voice Sounds for COVID-19 Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10548) to know more about the dataset. Note that the dataset size has increased since this paper came out. We also maintain a (less frequently updated) blog [here](https://iiscleap.github.io/coswara-blog/coswara/2020/11/23/visualize_coswara_data_metadata.html).

<strong>What is the structure of the repository?</strong>
Each folder contains metadata and audio recordings corresponding to contributors. The folder is compressed. To download and extract the data, you can run the script `extract_data.py`

<strong>What are the different sound samples?</strong>
Sound samples collected include breathing sounds (fast and slow), cough sounds (deep and shallow), phonation of sustained vowels (/a/ as in made, /i/,/o/), and counting numbers at slow and fast pace. Metadata information collected includes the participant's age, gender, location (country, state/ province), current health status (healthy/ exposed/ positive/recovered) and the presence of comorbidities (pre-existing medical conditions).

<strong>Can I see the metadata before downloading whole repository?</strong>
Yes. The file `combined_data.csv` contains a summary of metadata. The file `csv_labels_legend.json` contains information about the columns present in `combined_data.csv`.

<strong>Is there any audio quality check?</strong>
Yes. The audio files are manually listened and labeled as one of the three categories: 2(excellent), 1(good), 0(bad). The labels are present in the `annotations` folder.

<strong>How to cite this dataset in your work?</strong>
Great to know you found it useful. You can cite the paper: Coswara - A Database of Breathing, Cough, and Voice Sounds for COVID-19 Diagnosis (https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10548)

<strong>Is there any web application for COVID-19 screening based on respiratory acoustics?</strong>
Yes! One can record his/her respiratory sounds at [Coswara web application](https://coswara.iisc.ac.in/) and obtain a COVID-19 probability score in few seconds.
